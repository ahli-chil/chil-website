The AHLI CHIL 2024 Doctoral Symposium is an opportunity for PhD students to broadcast their research and get feedback on their directions from CHIL attendees and leaders in the field. Participants will present their ongoing and/or future doctoral dissertation work as a poster, encouraging discussion of ideas with senior leaders and CHIL participants. There is an additional opportunity to be selected for a 5 minute lightning presentation. Our main CFP can give an indication of the areas that are covered in CHIL. In addition to the lightning talks and poster session, participants will have facilitated opportunities to connect with and meet established researchers one-on-one throughout the conference. The Doctoral Symposium will be held on June 28, 2024 in New York City, NY, United States. It is an in-person event.
